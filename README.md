# The Textbook

## Free and high quality textbooks
The Textbook is a collection (or at least it will be) of free, open source textbooks on various topics within mathematics. Textbooks are often hugely expensive, and the people that need them are poor. We aim to make high quality textbooks on all of university mathematics, so that students have an alternative to the expensive books their used in the curriculum.

The Textbook is an open source project, which means you are free to help in any way you can. Also, as the project is somewhat new, a lot of work needs to be done. See the Collaborate section for more.


## Collaborate
### Major tasks
- Creating a website for hosting the books.
- Textbooks on new chapters like:
    - Probaility Theory
    - Group Theory
    - Logic
    - Linear Algebra
    - ...
- Design, including:
    - Frontpage design
    - General design
    - Maintain preamble
- Guide to collaborators
- Writing
- Quality control
- Communication between collaborators
- Unifying Notation?
    - For instance, should the powerset be denoted the same in all textbooks, and if so, how should it be written.
    - Make macros

### Minor tasks
- Continuous Spell checking
- Improvements of arguments and the like
