# The Textbook

## Free and high quality textbooks
The Textbook is a collection (or at least it will be) of free, open source textbooks on various topics within mathematics. Textbooks are often hugely expensive, and the people that need them are poor. We aim to make high quality textbooks on all of university mathematics, so that students have an alternative to the expensive books their used in the curriculum.

The Textbook is an open source project, which means you are free to help in any way you can. Also, as the project is somewhat new, a lot of work needs to be done. See the Collaborate section for more.
