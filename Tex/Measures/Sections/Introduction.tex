% Historical introduction would be nice
The ordinary integral that most students are failiar with when they start university, turns out to lack behind. Sure enough, you can integrate all the continuous and piecewise continuous functions, by the usual method of fitting thinner and thinner rectangles under the graph and adding their areas. However this leads a lot to be desired. It tunrs out, that there are other ways of defining integration that are a lot more powerful. To develop this new way, we will need to important ideas. We need to develop a theory of the "size" of a set, and we need to describe what sets can meaningfully be described a size.
