\section{Notation}
\subsection{Preferred notation in decreasing order}

Spaces (sets) are denoted by $X$.\\

$\sigma$-algebras are denoted in general by
$\m{A}, \m{B}, \dots$, with elements $A\in \m{A}$ or $A_{i}\in \m{A}$ and so on.\\

(General) Measures
$\mu, \lambda, \nu$\\

So a general measure space is denoted by $(X, \m{A}, \mu)$\\

Specific measures if needed
\begin{itemize}
\item The Lebesgue measure on $\R^{k}$ is denoted by $m_{k}=m$
\item The counting measure is denoted by $\tau$
\item The Dirac measure is denoted by $\delta_{a}$\\
\end{itemize}


Miscellaneous
The characteristic function (indicator function):
$\mathbbm{1}_{A}$.
